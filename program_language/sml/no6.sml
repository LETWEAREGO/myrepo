So T1 = int* int
So (abs y )+ z: int, so let-expression :int ,so body :int ,so T2=int
So f : int * int -> int

sum: T1 - T2 [must be a function : all functions take one argument]
xs : T1 [must have type of f's argument]

x : T3 [pattern match against T3 list]
xs': T3 list [pattern match against T3 list]

T1 =T3 list [else pattern-match on doesn't type-check]
0: int,so case-expression :int ,so body :int,so T2=int
T3 = int [because x :T3 and argument to addition]
T2 = int [because result of recursive call is argument to addition]
sum xs' type-checks because xs' has type T3 lsit and T1 =T3 list
case-expression  type-checks because both branches have type int

from T1 =T3 list and T3 =int , we know T1= int list
from that and T2 = int ,we know f : int list -> int

fun sum xs =
   case xs of 
     []=> 0
    |x::xs' => x+(sum xs')


(*
type inference proceeds exactly like for sum for most of it:
broken_sum :T1 -T2 [must be a function : all functions take one argument]
xs : T1 [must have type of f' argument]

x:T3[pattern match against T3 list]
xs':T3 list [pattern match against T3 list]

T1=T3 list [else pattern-match on doesn't type-check]
0:int,so case-expression :int,so body :int,so T2=int
T3=int [because x:T3 and argument to addition]
T2=int [because result of recursive call is argument to addition]

but now to type-check (broken_sum x), we need T3 =T1 and T1=T3 list
so we need T3 =T3 list ,which is impossible for any T3

Note :the actual type-checker might gather facts in a different order and
therefore report a different error , but it will report an error.
